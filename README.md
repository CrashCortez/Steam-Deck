# Steam-Deck
Steam Deck emulators and launcher “possibilities” on Linux. 

For those new to Linux you can use the following links to install Linux versions of programs, or instructions on how to use a program with wine on Linux. 

Wine is a comparability layer for linux to use windows programs. proton/lutris is based on wine. 

For those of you in the know, here is a list I have started for testing, it’s stuff that I want to try when the Steam Deck is in my hands. 

And of course we won’t know how these all work until tested. 

Emulators 
——————

RetroPie (Setup scripts with frontends, RetroArch, and standalone emulators from Atari to PS2/GameCube/Wii on archlinx) I don’t think this retropie will work actually. Steam os is archlinux based. So we will need to build for arch. 

Found one an “unsable” arch version. It’s a start looks like it has most of the retropie scripts for stuff up to dolphin and pcsx2

If the following emulators work, you can probably launch them from steam or link them up with emulationstation retropie setup , steam I do on my emulationstation and steam on windows.
